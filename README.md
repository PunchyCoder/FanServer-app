## Struggles
* Adding basic toggle funcion to syopsis-display on button click. The key was to use event.stopImmediatPropagation... google it.
* Looked all over for a way to make container grow to fit content; found width/height: fit-content; Simply amazing.
* Figured out the synopsis/trailer button event-logic was a pain. I wasn't referencing the right element in jQuery; code needs refinement.
* More struggles coming soon.

### Notes
- It might be worthwhile to make a list of features/objectives to complete on here(README) and ~~cross em' off~~ as I develop.
- I'm beginning to kinda' enjoy the process of logging my struggles and at least part of my process. I may do something more in-depth.
